Bug Tracking System

For this project, I used the Mantis BT defect tracking system to create defects for a software application. To assist me in logging some meaningful defects, I downloaded a simple web application from the internet. To use this web application, I installed XAMPP and ran the Apache server on my PC. 

The requirements for the web application are as follows:
•	This web app allows users to register for an event called “THE Event!”. <br />
•	Registrants must provide their first name, last name, address, city,
province and postal code along with their phone number and
email address. <br />
•	Registrants must also provide the number of participants attending
and what day(s) they want to attend (either Day 1 or Day 2 or Both) <br />
  o	Registrants attending Day 1 will be charged $450 <br />
  o	Registrants attending Day 2 will be charged $350 <br />
  o	Registrants attending Day 1 and Day 2 will be charged $750
  (as opposed to $800) <br />
•	Registrants registering more than five participants will be given a
10% discount <br />
•	Links are to be provided at the top of the web app to “THE Event!”,
the home page, and to the main page of Conestoga College. <br />
•	The list of provinces needs to contain all Canadian
provinces and territories in an increasingly alphabetized
drop-down list <br />
•	The Phone Number field must only accept phone numbers of the
form 111-111-1111 or (111)111-1111 <br />
•	The Postal Code field must only accept in the format A1A 1A1
(where A represents an alpha character A-Z and 1 represents a
digit from 0-9) <br />
•	Upon registering, a new page should show: <br />
  o	The number of participants <br />
  o	The days they are registered for <br />
  o	The total price (there is no tax or any other fees) <br />
  o	Users should be able to go back to the main page after
  registering through a link. <br />

After finding all the defects with this application, I created a Word document containing all my found defects as individual screenshots and an overall view of all the defects by summary and severity. I even provided the screenshots of the “Summary” and “Summary- By Severity” reports of the defects that were logged using “Mantis Graphs” plugin.

After logging defects, I analyzed the defects logged from this application and provided a recommendation as to whether or not this application is ready to be released to end customers.
