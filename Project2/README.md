In this project, I developed a Mind Map using Mind Map Maker as part of an overall Test Strategy for testing a software application as well as developing the associated test cases using Test Collab for this application.

The application is an online video game rental store that patrons can search for/reserve/sign-out and download video games. The requirements for this system are as follows: </br>
• All users may browse the website as guests or as registered users but only registered users can reserve
and/or sign-out video games. </br>
• Registered users can login to the site through their email and password only after they have first
registered with the system. </br>
• All users can search for games by: </br>
o Title </br>
o Maker </br>
o Date Published / Created </br>
o Cost to rent </br>
• The system will allow the user to sort the returned information based on availability, name of item,
maker, date published and cost </br>
• Only registered users can select items (up to a maximum of three titles) they wish to reserve / sign-out
(providing they are available). When the user signs-out items, they are given a link from which to
download the game(s). Each item is provided with a 21-day loan, except for new games – which are
only allowed to be rented for three days. Upon the expiry date, the game is automatically deleted
from the user’s computer, and the item’s status becomes available for the next registered user. </br>
• Registered users can also view/update their personal information </br>
• Registered users can pay for their purchases online through either a valid credit card or through
PayPal. </br>
• The system allows a maximum of 2500 total users to be on the system simultaneously </br>
• The system needs to be functional on Windows 10 desktop browsers such as Chrome, FireFox, and
Edge as well as Apple tablet mobile devices (iPads) for the same list of browsers including Safari. </br>
• The system also needs to maintain security by ensuring that personal and/or any financial information
from the user is not leaked or compromised by unauthorized users. </br>
