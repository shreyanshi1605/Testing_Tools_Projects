Performance Testing

The purpose of this project was to explore the Reconnaissance and Scanning stages of a Penetration Test. 
In this project, I attempted to exploit the Metasploitable2 Virtual Machine. As a part of this project, I </br>
- scanned all of the IP addresses on the network on which both the VMs are on </br>
- and showed the final stats </br>
Once Iâ€™ve determined the correct IP address of the Metaspoitable2 VM, use NMAP and performed a single scan with the following options: TCP SYN, OS detection, version detection, and verbose output.
Then I provided the entire NMAP output as a screenshot, highlighting the section that you have selected to investigate for vulnerabilities. Research this version of the
service. </br>
 - When was it released? </br>
 - Is it the newest version? If not, when was it updated? </br>
 - Is there a known vulnerability for this service? If so, how
this version is vulnerable and what the vulnerability allows an attacker to do. </br>
 - Again, what would you I with this information as part
of completing the Penetration Test on this system. Demonstrate the next steps to
help explain your points by using the appropriate commands in Kali and provide a
brief recommendation on your findings as well as the next steps that a client can do
to safeguard their systems from your chosen attack type.
